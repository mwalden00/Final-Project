# Graphics Final Project Proposal

Maximilian Walden, Pd 5

## Additions

- Added the `light` command
  - the sysntax is `light x y z R G B`
  - with the implementation of this command, I removed included light.
- Added .obj file support
  - Using the `obj` command, the engine can convert a given model to polygons.
    - Syntax: `obj fileName.obj`
  - There is no texture support, so some models may appear weird / have holes.
  - scaling may be required as some .obj files have very small polygons for the sake of scaling.

Exampls .mdl file:

```
# Define light values
light 255 255 255 255 255 255

# Make sure to scale and move the .obj
push
move 255 25 0
scale 100 100 100

# Import your .obj
obj my_Obj.obj

display
```

In my final project module, I have two .mdl files. Both are run upon a `make` command.

The first one, `test_light.mdl`, is a script that creates a sphere in the center and two lights, one green and one purple.
The other, `mars.mdl`, renders a high polygon image of the statue of Mars, with the same lights as `test_light.mdl`.
