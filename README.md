#Graphics Final Project Proposal

Maximilian Walden, Pd 5

Features I'92d like to implement:

* implementing the mdl mesh command
  * using external .obj files with the mesh command
* implementing the light command
* possibly implementing a new bezier patch basic object
  * this would just use the standard bezier patch algorithm, and is an extension of the bezier command
